        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>By downloading or using the TinyRest app, you agree to the terms outlined below.</p>

        <div class="disclaimer">
            <strong>⚠️ IMPORTANT MEDICAL DISCLAIMER</strong><br>
            TinyRest is a data tracking and informational tool only. <strong>It is NOT a medical device.</strong> The AI predictions, insights, and wake windows provided by this app are estimates based on general data and do not constitute medical advice. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something you have read on this app. Always consult a pediatrician for concerns regarding your baby's health or sleep.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
        <p>You agree to use TinyRest only for lawful purposes. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account. The "Partner Notes" feature allows text input; you agree not to use this feature to harass, abuse, or send illegal content to other users.</p>

        <h2>2. AI Features</h2>
        <p>Our "Smart Insights" are generated by Artificial Intelligence (Google Gemini). While we strive for accuracy, AI models can occasionally produce incorrect or "hallucinated" results. You acknowledge that you use these predictions at your own discretion and risk.</p>

        <h2>3. Family Syncing</h2>
        <p>TinyRest allows you to share data with a partner via an Invite Code. By sharing this code, you grant that individual full access to view and edit your baby's sleep logs and notes. You are responsible for keeping your Invite Code secure.</p>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The TinyRest app, including its original content, features, and functionality, is owned by us and is protected by international copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</p>

        <h2>5. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you breach these Terms.</p>

        <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. We will notify users of any significant changes via the app or email.</p>
